title = WBR-120M Graphene Radiator
manufacturer = Wild Blue Industries
description = Originally created to be the world's biggest spatula to cook the world's biggest pancake, its segmented design proved too flimsy to handle the load. But Wild Blue Industries saw its potential as a heat radiator for spacecraft and licensed the design. its cardboard-like construction allows coolant to flow through the hollow spaces. Engineers still insist tha the radiator IS made from cardboard despite proof of its graphene construction materials.
