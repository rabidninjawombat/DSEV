Nuclear engine types

title = Aerospike Atomic Rocket Motor
manufacturer = Wild Blue Industries
description = The aerospike atomic rocket motor incorporates Wild Blue's Oxidizer Augmented Thrust System (O.A.T.S.). O.A.T.S. gives the engine an "afterburner" that generates high thrust at the expense of ISP but even in low-power mode, its thrust and ISP are comparable to the LV-N

Note: The aerospike requires fuel rods. density = 0.01982 metric tons per unit

title = Supernova Fusion Engine
manufacturer = Wild Blue Industries
description = Harness the power of an exploding sun! Well, a tiny artificial sun-like blob of fusion fire that exists for microseconds. The Supernova concentrates its Waxon-Waxoff Corporation electromagnets, focusing their power into a crushing blow that fuses fusion pellets into white hot plasma. The plasma then mixes with propellant pumped through the engine's center, which is then ejected out the magnetic nozzle to produce thrust. Alternately, switch to pure fusion pellet power for lower thrust and higher ISP. The Supernova needs a significant amount of electric charge to start up, and the reactor's fusion pellets will need periodic replenishment, and well, there's this heat problem...

50 tons mass
Low-power mode: 600 kn thrust, 35,000 sec ISP
hi-power mode: 1,800 kn thrust, 3,500 sec ISP
Both modes consume a small amount of FusionPellets per second.
Generates WasteHeat: 2100 MW in pulsed plasma mode?
Needs 40MJ (40,000 EC) to start
in KSPI, 1 MJ = 1000 ElectricCharge

NASA version needed 108MW to start up
7895 MW power, 96% charged particles
6037 MW used for propulsion
1858 left over

1600 MW to radiators

 643 MW to space
NASA design has 35,000 sec ISP, 27 kn thrust.

FusionPellets: density = 0.000006 metric tons (6 grams) per unit
you can create fusion pellets from Jool's atmosphere. Simplified process of collecting lithium, deuterium, and helium-3
Each small pellet tank holds 150 units of FusionPellets

fusion uses .01 grams per sec to .001 grams per second (0.06 units per second, less per unity update)

1 cubic meter = 1000 liters = 1000 units
beanbag beans: 100 liters = 600 grams

spherical tanks combine heat radiators with stack decouplers? 8,000 units of FusionPellets

Supernova Support Truss: 3.75mm part with hex sides. Contains 4k in battery packs, strong SAS unit, one FusionPellet tank, six RTG generators?



liquid droplet radiators! Kryofluid is pumped through the LDRs to dump heat. small amount of kryofluid is lost in the process. Kryofluid is of course made from karbonite and water; 2 units of karbonite + 10 units of water = 8 units of kryofluid.

Deployed: 1.875m wide, 7.5m long, sheds 350MW (350000 J), 2000k temperature, wedge shaped

components: pump, tanks, heat exchanger


BN-1 Radial Atomic Motor
.625 radially mounted NTR engine.
24kn with afterburner. Afterburner only, and 650 sec isp. But, it's radially mounted.

Fusion Pellet Tank
description = Scavanged from the finest beanbag storage tanks that have been left out in the sun too long, this tank now holds large amounts of fusion pellets for use in fusion reactors.

BOT holds 6400, has 35.91 cubic meters (roughly 36000 liters)
density LFO 0.005
2880 liquid fuel = 14.4 mt
3520 oxidizer = 17.6 mt
tank mass = 4
total mass = 36mt
5.625 liters per unit

LG pellet tank has 9.37 cubic meters (9370 liters)
9730/5.625 = 1665.78 units


NOV 3 - 8 Kim Vegas
mono density: .004
Stratus V volume: .24 cubic meters (240 liters)
Units: 150
Units per liter: 0.625

small pellet tank
volume: .16 cubic meters (160 liters)
units (based on mono tank): 100

Medium pellet tank

Large pellet tank
31.63 cubic meters (31630 liters)
31630/5.63 = 5618 units

Note: 

title = ZK-2000 Nuclear Salted Fizzy Water Engine
manufacturer = Wild Blue Industries
description = The ZK-2000 is a simple engine that takes advantage of the superheated steam created when blutonium dissolved in sparking "fizzy" water undergoes nuclear fission. Nuclear Salted Fizzy Water (NSFW) offers high thrust and excellent ISP compared to conventional rockets- even conventional atomic rockets. But the engine is banned in Kerbin's atmosphere due to its highly radioactive exhaust, not to mention its tendency to kill kerbonauts up to 2km away.

title = NSFW-32 Fuel Tank
manufacturer = Wild Blue Industries
description = Nuclear Salted Fizzy Water (NSFW) is a highly volitile and radioactive propellant. When the dissolved blutonium undergoes nuclear fission, it heats the sparkling water into superheated steam. The fuel tank is lined with boron karbide to dampen the nuclear reactions. Warranty void if the tank ruptures.

Note: to make NSFW in the field you need CarbonDioxide/karbonite, Water, and blutonium. One unit of NSFW is made from .02 units of blutonium, .01 units of CarbonDioxide, and .97 units of Water.
